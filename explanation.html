                <h4 id="subheading" class="subheading">What are the 3 Writing Systems?</h4>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    To keep things brief, the Japanese language has three writing systems: Hiragana,
                    Katakana, and Kanji. Hiragana and Katakana are both syllabic writing systems, meaning that each
                    character represents a syllable (a block of sounds made up of a combination of consonants and
                    vowels), but each character does not have any intrinsic meaning. Basically, the character 「あ」
                    (pronounced like the 'a' in 'father') has a pronunciation, but the character does not have any
                    meaning behind it. All three scripts are crucial to learning Japanese, as each script has its own
                    purpose and all three are heavily used in everyday life.

                <h4 id="subheading" class="subheading">What is Hiragana?</h4>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    <a class="external-link" target="__blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana">Hiragana
                        (ひらがな)</a> is the more commonly-used of the two syllabic scripts in Japanese. While Kanji is
                    used for the <a class="external-link" target="__blank"
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_word">content words</a>, Hiragana is used for the <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_word" class="external-link">function words</a> and
                    inflections. Each Hiragana character is one syllable comprised of a vowel and/or a consonant. For
                    example, the word 「ひらがな」 is pronounced as 'hi-ra-ga-na'. There are 46 Hiragana characters, plus
                    diagraphs and diacritics (see <a class="external-link" target="__blank"
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana">Wikipedia</a> for more info).

                <h4 id="subheading" class="subheading">What is Katakana?</h4>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    <a class="external-link" target="__blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana">Katakana
                        (カタカナ)</a> is the counterpart writing
                    system to Hiragana, as it mirrors it in structure and use. In the word 「カタカナ」 (Katakana), each
                    syllable is pronounced as such: 'ka-ta-ka-na'. Katakana also is comprised of 46
                    characters plus diagraphs and diacritics, though its use is quite different. While Hiragana is used
                    to fill in the the areas of a sentence that Kanji does not, Katakana is reserved for a very specific
                    use: <a class="external-link" target="__blank"
                        href="https://www.nihongomaster.com/blog/japanese-onomatopoeia-guide/">Onomatopeoia</a> and <a
                        class="external-link" target="__blank"
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gairaigo">Loanwords</a>. Just because its use is limited
                    does not mean that Katakana is not important to master though.

                <h4 id="subheading" class="subheading">What is Kanji?</h4>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    On the other hand, <a class="external-link" target="__blank"
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji">Kanji (漢字)</a> is a logographic writing system,
                    meaning that each character has both
                    a pronunciation and a meaning. Kanji are characters that were borrowed from the Chinese writing
                    system
                    many centuries ago and have become an integral part of Japanese reading and writing. As it is most
                    commonly used for nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, it is easy to see why Kanji is so
                    important. It is basically used for the most important parts of a sentence!

                <h4 id="subheading" class="subheading">This Quiz Application</h4>
                <p class="paragraph">The purpose of this quiz is to help users learn and memorize Japanese Hiragana and
                    Katakana. They are the building blocks of the Japanese writing system, and without this
                    comprehension, learning Japanese Kanji will be nearly impossible. I recommend studying the charts in
                    the Wikipedia articles found in each section above to get an overview of each character, as well as
                    what diagraphs and diacritics are in relation to the Japanese writing system. While each writing
                    script has 46 unique characters, when
                    including the diagraphs and diacritics separately, each of the quizzes in this app has a whopping
                    104 questions. Study hard and have fun!</p>
