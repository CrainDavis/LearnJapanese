## Description
This is a quiz app for users to learn how to read Japanese Hiragana and Katakana. 

To keep things brief, the Japanese language has three writing systems: Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. Hiragana and Katakana are both syllabic writing systems, meaning that each character represents a syllable (a block of sounds made up of a combination of consonants and vowels), but each character does not have any intrinsic meaning. Basically, the character __「あ」__ (pronounced like the __'a'__ in 'father') has a pronunciation, but the character does not have any meaning behind it. All three scripts are crucial to learning Japanese, as each script has its own purpose and all three are heavily used in everyday life.

### What is __Hiragana__?
__[Hiragana (ひらがな)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana)__ is more the more commonly-used of the two syllabic scripts in Japanese. While Kanji is used for the [content words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_word), Hiragana is typically used for the [function words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_word) and inflections. Each Hiragana character is one syllable comprised of a vowel and/or a consonant. For example, the word 「ひらがな」 is pronounced as 'hi-ra-ga-na'. There are 46 Hiragana characters, plus diagraphs and diacritics (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana) for more information).

### What is __Katakana__?
__[Katakana (カタカナ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana)__ is the counterpart writing system to Hiragana, as it mirrors it in structure and use. In the word 「カタカナ」 (Katakana), each syllable is pronounced as such: "ka-ta-ka-na'. Katakana also is comprised of 46 characters plus diagraphs and diacritics, though its use is quite different. While Hiragana is used together with Kanji to fill in the areas of a sentence that Kanji does not, Katakana is reserved for a very specific use: [Onomatopoeia](https://www.nihongomaster.com/blog/japanese-onomatopoeia-guide/) and [_"Gairaigo"_, aka foreign loanwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gairaigo). Just because its use is limited does not mean that Katakana is not important to master though.

### What is __Kanji__?
On the other hand, __[Kanji (漢字)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji)__ is a logographic writing system, meaning that each character has both a pronunciation and a meaning. Kanji are characters that were borrowed from the Chinese writing system many centuries ago and have become an integral part of Japanese reading and writing. As it is most commonly used for nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, it is easy to see why Kanji is so important when learning and using Japanese. It is basically used for the most important parts of a sentence!

### This Quiz Application:
The purpose of this quiz is to help beginners learn and memorize Japanese Hiragana and Katakana. They are the building blocks of the Japanese writing system, and without this comprehension, learning Japanese Kanji will be nearly impossible. I recommend studying the charts below to get an overview of each character, as well as what diagraphs and diacritics are in relation to the Japanese writing system. While each writing script has 46 unique characters, when including the diagraphs and diacritics separately, each of the quizzes in this app has over 100 questions. Study hard and have fun!
